The state has an area of about 163,696 square miles, which makes it the third largest state in the US in terms of land area. In terms of population, California is the biggest state. The capital city is Sacramento while Los Angeles is the most populated city in the state. The population size of Los Angeles is second only to that of New York City among the cities in the US. Another interesting fact about California is that it has the largest economy of any state. For these reasons and others, the state is known globally for several things ranging from entertainment and relaxation to business and economy. \n\n## Business Problem\nA customer decided to expand his Japanese restaurant chain to California which has the largest economy of any state and high polulation. But how do they decide where should open their restaurant? There could be lots of factors that could potentially affect how the business would go, so choosing the right neighborhood is critical!\n\nThe idea of this study is to help the customer planning to open a Japanese restaurant in California to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.\n\n##### Factors that should be taken into consideration\n\n*Demographical Insights of the Neighborhoods*\n\nDemographical data can also affect how well the restaurant runs. It is very important to figure out the income and population of the neighborhoods and what are the preferences that people from different neighborhood have in order to choose the perfect place for a restaurant. By looking at the customers data, we should be able to find out which neighborhood enjoys what kind of food the most and how often do they go to a specific restaurant and so on.\n\n*Competing Restaurants*\n\nAnother factor we have to think is other competitors. Foursquare can provide us with the data of each neighborhood with the information on their top restaurants and even photos and comments. So we can avoid open restaurant in the neighborhood which has too much competitor.",

It contains Population, Average income of the places in California.\n\n2. Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.\n\nThe majority of the data used in this project will be taken from Foursquare API, which is a crowd sourced, comprehensive geographical data source. With Foursquare API, we will be able to get insight on the most popular venues in each neighborhood, their photos, ratings and customer comments on those venues.",
